#FACIAL RECOGNITION USING RASPBERRY PI CAM

#In this project, we collect a custom dataset using headshots.py
#We can also upload images of the people to be recognised

#The train_model.py will create a file named encodings.pickle
#We are using the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)for face detection
#To carry out face recognition, run face_recognition.py
#We are using Haar Cascade Classifier (frontal-face) for face recognition

#First install OpenCV, face_recognition, imutils
#Use Geany to run the python code
